# My Personal Portfolio ‚ú®
Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This is a web application showcasing my skills and projects. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me!

## üåü Features

- **Smooth Scrolling with React Scroll**:  
   I implemented **React Scroll** to provide smooth navigation between sections of the portfolio. When a user clicks on the navigation links in the fixed navbar, the page scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section, improving the user experience.

- **Contact Form with EmailJS**:  
   The contact form is integrated with **EmailJS**, allowing users to send messages directly to my email without needing a backend. This makes it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out directly through the portfolio.

- **Responsive Design**:  
   The entire portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, including phones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Hover Effects**:  
   I added hover effects to links and buttons to create a more interactive and dynamic user experience.
